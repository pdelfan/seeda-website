            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                <p class="font-extra-large">
                    Design of any large industrial process plant is inconceivable without continuous spatial
                    coordination
                    between designers and engineers of three engineering disciplines: Mechanical/Piping, Structural and
                    Electrical. 3D-modelling software employed for the given project serves as the common
                    three-dimensional
                    medium for interdisciplinary coordination. The obvious benefits of such approach have been discussed
                    in
                    multiple publications and would be beyond the topic of the present article.
                </p>

                <p class="font-extra-large">
                    The new, uncharted area and the main topic of this article is coordination between the engineers
                    of
                    Mechanical-Piping (further called Piping-Stress) and Civil-Structural Disciplines. The present
                    predicament is that although the noted-above engineers create 3D analytical models of remarkable
                    complexity, they still work in virtual isolation and have a chance to employ computer technology
                    for
                    coordination only in a roundabout way i.e. after their designs have been integrated into 3D-CAD
                    environment by designers.
                </p>

                <p class="font-extra-large">
                    Moreover, the vast amounts of data incorporated within engineer’s
                    models
                    as well as the massive analyses outputs has to be conveyed to the engineer of another discipline
                    only by conservative means of print-outs and manual mark-ups. On the positive note, with the
                    significant progress of engineering analytical software,
                    interdisciplinary coordination of ‘engineering’ 3D models became feasible from technical
                    perspective and modern engineers are geared up for it.

                <h3>Analytical or ‘Engineering’ 3D Models
                </h3>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <div>
                        <p>It is worth noting that analytical models generated by engineers differ significantly from
                            those
                            created by designers though both types of models are being created to depict the same
                            designs.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The visual difference between first and second figures is apparent: models generated by
                            designers are more realistic – they represent ‘full body’ images of piping components and
                            structural members. Unlike these models an analytical model generated by an engineer is a
                            schematic representation of linear members (as single lines) and joints or nodes (as
                            circles).
                            What is not shown on the graphic screen of an analytical model is the vast multitude of
                            alphanumerical data associated with these members and joints: constraint conditions, member
                            mechanical properties, loads, load cases and load combinations.
                        </p>
                        <p>This drastic difference is not resulting from software deficiencies nor from the industry
                            traditions; it could be explained solely by the difference of purposes for which the models
                            are generated.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>For at least two decades Structural engineers and Piping-Stress engineers have been creating
                            relatively complex and detailed 3D models using their respective software: for Structural -
                            STAAD, RISA, S-Frame, and SAP2000 and alike, for Piping-Stress - Caesar, Auto-Pipe and alike
                            (let’s name them further ‘analytical models’). This analytical software became powerful and
                            reliable enough to process hundreds of linear members and node joints whereas the new
                            generation of engineers became comfortable dealing with massive inputs and outputs.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>Engineering modeling accuracy and complexity have achieved almost the same level as those of
                            the designer’s 3D modeling. The purpose of the engineering modeling is entirely different –
                            it is repetitive computer analyses (with each optimization step) and further design based on
                            the analyses output. The graphic interface of most CAE programs fits this purpose; unlike
                            3D-CAD models, the analytical models display the ‘wire-line’ or simplified graphics
                            neglecting elaborate 3D shapes (see Fig. 2 above). While creating analytical model the
                            engineer deliberately omits numerous minute components non-essential for analyses. On
                            another hand, engineers, unlike designers, input vast amount of alphanumerical data related
                            to the visible components: various conditions, loads, load-combinations, restraints and
                            properties alike.
                        </p>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <div>
                        <p>The analytical models created by engineers have been gradually obtaining the same status, the
                            same permanent value as the 3D models created by designers, namely:

                            <br><br>
                            - Analytical models are repeatedly re-analyzed and modified/optimized from the project’s
                            start
                            to finish.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            - Some of these models may be split between two engineers or transferred from one engineer
                            to
                            another within the same group.
                            <br><br>
                            - More clients are becoming convinced that analytical models could be effectively reused for
                            future phases of the same Project. Hence, they request such models as part of the ‘turn-over
                            package’ along with 2D-drawing, 3D parametric models, material take-off’s, engineering
                            design briefs, and other ‘electronic deliverables’.

                        <p>Similarly, for the last two decades the working environment, the efficacy and reliability of
                            the professional software, the approaches, skills and working mentality for engineers and
                            designers underwent such evolution.
                        </p>
                        <p>Yet, this convergent evolution is incomplete; we can observe the obvious absence of an
                            engineering 3D graphic medium that would enable efficient visual coordination and electronic
                            data exchange among engineers.

                <h3>STRUNA - the solution</h3>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            The above-noted 3D medium (further names STRUNA for Stress-Structural Navigator) could be
                            and should be developed as new program independent from the engineering analytical software.
                            This new program should be open to importing the input and output files from the analytical
                            programs, should conveniently display geometry and related alphanumerical information per
                            user’s request, and should transfer and properly incorporate into related input files the
                            data selected by either the structural or the piping-stress user.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>Aside of visual interdisciplinary coordination two major functions of STRUNA are to be:
                            <br><br>
                            - Transfer of reaction forces from Piping-System(s) support nodes to the relevant points on
                            supporting structural members
                            <br><br>
                            - Transfer of critical displacements from structural output to the properties of the
                            user-selected piping supports
                            <br><br>
                            In addition, the specific needs of engineering users should be addressed by a whole plethora
                            of utilities.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            For structural users these utilities will automate or greatly facilitate the following load
                            input:
                            <br><br>
                            - wind and snow loads on open structure,
                            <br><br>
                            - preliminary piping and cable-tray ‘blanket’ loads
                            <br><br>
                            - operator platform and cut-walks - dead and life loads
                            <br><br>
                            - seismic static-equivalent ‘base shear’ distribution
                            <br><br>
                            - collection of load combination sets
