                        <p>Too many construction projects go over budget and are not completed on schedule. Both of
                            these can have a drastic impact on the overall economics of a project. The lack of design
                            innovation and construction efficiency is the primary cause of these problems. Even in the
                            second millennium, there is significant room for improvement at a project planning phase
                            that if appropriately addressed could ensure greater sustainability of most projects.

                        <p> Even in the second millennium, there is significant room for improvement at a project
                            planning phase that if appropriately addressed could ensure greater sustainability of most
                            projects.
                        </p>

                        <p>The current method of “Design – Construction” within a single organization may not
                            necessarily consider all the outcomes at the end of construction and handover to operations.
                            In fact, sometimes newly built facilities do not serve communities and stakeholders as
                            planned. This is often because from the very beginning suppliers and vendors are asked to
                            deliver their scope of work at the lowest cost without much consideration for what is best
                            for the lifetime and socio-economics of the project.
                        </p>

                        <p>A small initial investment in a “Sustainability Study” by an objective team of experienced
                            professionals to review the project profile, before the designers turn on the computers or
                            the shovels hit the ground, will pay dividends during the construction and operation of the
                            project. This is the essence of “Sustainable Development”.
