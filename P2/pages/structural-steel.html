            <h3>Introduction</h3>

                        Large metal modules hold together enormous volumes of pipes and equipment in the oil & gas
                        gathering and process facilities. Design companies use different methods to build module frames
                        at lowest possible cost for a particular project. Structural material designed for a one-time
                        application without much consideration of material recycling.
                    </p>

                    <p>The life cycle of oil & gas facilities is about 30 -50 years followed by demolition and land
                        reclamation. In contrast, treated and properly maintained structural steel could last hundreds
                        of years similar to old bridges.

                    <p>
                        This document reviews, in general terms, potential benefits of designing universal structural
                        Components for reuse of steel from project to project. Why should quality steel go to scrap just
                        because of its unique form?

                <h3>Module Steel
                </h3>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">

                    <p>
                        Steel is made from iron ore and scrap mostly overseas. Production of metal and related transport
                        arrangements require lots of work and energy. Ocean vessels with the material bulk from China
                        and other countries returning with scrap metal for reprocessing. The volume of metal in this
                        cycle increases every year with growing demand.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Complex projects employ several steel fabricators that are often far away from a construction
                        site. Combined with different locations of module yards custom steel creates many logistics
                        challenges. Misplaced or late delivered custom build material usually has no other use and goes
                        to scrap or waste.
                    </p>

                    <p>The use of universal structural components could reduce material transfers and allow steel
                        fabrication in large volumes for multiple projects without having to ship materials from place
                        to place several times. Monies saved on logistics could allow better material selection for
                        improved quality and longer service.
                    </p>

                    <p>Standardization of structural members to common sizes and shapes for reuse from project to
                        project would allow desired flexibility, extended material service, and fewer emissions. Subject
                        to further research and agreement by the industry.

                        Alberta heavy haul shipping envelope of 24 ft wide x 24 ft high x 120 ft long is a good starting
                        point for steel length and shape selection.

                            The benefits of a successful implementation would include:

                            -Reducing risks of schedule delays due to lost or misplaced materials

                            -Planning to lower scrap volumes in the future
                            <br>
                            -Outsourcing fabrication of standard items overseas
                            <br>
                            -Reusing structural steel from project to project
                            <br>
                            -Better control of materials
                            <br>
                            -Lesser environmental impact

                <h3>Conclusion

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <p>Universal structural components for modules, pipe racks, and skids could provide better material
                        and schedule flexibility at lower overall cost. Reuse of materials means extending metal service
                        while minimizing scrap, waste, and associated emissions.
