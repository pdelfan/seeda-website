                    This document is presented by two Canadian civil engineers; one in mid-career, and the other
                    long-retired after more than 40 years practicing as a consulting engineer. Historically, engineers
                    have a long history of planning, design, construction, and innovation on a wide variety of projects.
                    Thousands of years ago in Egypt they built pyramids and invented new irrigation technology. In the
                    Greco-Roman period of Mediterranean empires, they developed innovative infrastructure and built
                    massive structures. Far to the east they constructed the Great Wall to defend China, as well as the
                    Grand Canal to connect two major rivers. Nearer to home, engineers played an important role in
                    stitching the east and west of Canada together in the late 1800s with the design and construction of
                    the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR).

                <p>
                    The authors of this report have worked on a wide variety of development projects across Canada, and
                    in over 40 other countries in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Africa. This experience has identified
                    in Canada some serious problems with the political structure of this 150 year old nation, and has
                    generated ideas that would improve Canada as it moves into its next 50 years. The major problem
                    seems to be a fiefdom mentality hangover from North America’s colonial past. The authors have
                    concentrated on currently available facts, and realize that some of their ideas may be controversial
                    in many parts of the country.

                    Re-engineering Canada is not a project for older professionals sitting philosophically in
                    comfortable think-tank offices. We believe everyone can contribute to our initiatives. It must be
                    developed, and adopted so the benefits are available for children in the future when Canada
                    celebrates its 200th birthday in 2067, and beyond. There are some signs that this change has already
                    started with recent proposals to reduce inter-provincial trade and professional barriers. However,
                    there is much more that needs to be done to change Canada into a dynamic united country with an
                    expanding and vibrant economy. The provincial government in British Columbia raises alarm bells
                    where that government wants to stop the construction of an oil pipeline plus the development of a
                    hydroelectric project that will produce thousands of megawatts of “"green"” electric power. This
                    type of politics demonstrates a lack of clear thinking, and little regard for the Canadian
                    environment or economy.

                    This document proposes radical changes that could significantly improve the lives of Canada’s
                    citizens. It would be the authors’ objectives that, as the country celebrates its 200th anniversary,
                    the colonial fiefdom mentality would have been totally eliminated. A Canadian citizen’s first
                    loyalty is to their country, and only then to the province.

                <h3>Definition of the problem</h3>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <div>
                        <p>Today Canada is a multi-cultural parliamentary democracy within the British Commonwealth with
                            the
                            British Monarch as the head of state. Canada is a member of every logical international
                            organization and scores high on any list of desirable countries for future economic growth
                            based
                            on the present standard of living. Canada can do better!
                        </p>

                        <p>Canada is currently divided into ten provinces and three territories that have a very wide
                            variation in physical area, population size, and density. The provinces all maintain three
                            levels of government; federal, provincial, and municipal, plus having vastly different
                            economies. The territories have enormous land areas, miniscule populations and are basically
                            governed and funded by the Federal government in geographically-distant Ottawa. Prior to the
                            arrival of Europeans in the 1500s, Canada had a significant indigenous population whose
                            ancestors had crossed a land or ice bridge from Asia to Alaska some 50,000 years earlier.
                        </p>

                        <p>Only six provinces have direct access to ocean tidewater. Two have access to Hudson Bay which
                            can
                            only connect to the oceans during the summer season, and the other two provinces are
                            land-locked. During recent years there have been outbreaks of fiefdom fever where the
                            development of various pipelines from land-locked provinces is being opposed by their
                            neighbouring provinces, and thus cause significant damage to the national and provincial
                            economies and individual livelihood of Canadians. The two land-locked provinces are the
                            largest
                            producers of many natural resources and agricultural products in Canada.

                <h3>Historical Background
                </h3>

                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <p>During the Age of Discovery Christopher Columbus and James Cook, adventurous sea captains of
                        different centuries, sailed into unknown seas and discovered the Americas (1492) and
                        Australasia (1770) respectively. Columbus had been retained by the Spanish Monarch and Cook
                        was an officer in the British Navy. Both explorers firmly planted the national flags of
                        their respective European nations on the shores of these new lands. Both continents already
                        had indigenous inhabitants but this did not deter the European explorers in claiming the
                        lands for their respective European countries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 15th and 16th centuries, explorers from many European nations followed the path of
                        Columbus across the Atlantic to establish colonies in the Americas – the Spanish, British,
                        French, Portuguese and Dutch were the most active colonizers. The European colonies in the
                        Americas were established to provide economic benefits to European monarchs plus their
                        friends, business partners and families. Thus colonies became fiefdoms, each one mainly
                        interested in their own welfare and economies.
                    </p>
                    <p>The British Crown claimed much of the east coast, and some of the west coast of North
                        America. The French preferred the lands adjacent to large rivers and established colonies
                        along the St. Lawrence estuary, upstream as far the Great Lakes, and also along the
                        Mississippi river – both rivers gave them excellent access to the interior of the North
                        American continent. The other European nations had plenty of territory to claim in South
                        America, the southern regions of North America and around the Caribbean.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As European wars spread to North America, the French lost territory to Britain at the battle on
                        the Plains of Abraham near Quebec City in 1759. Soon after that victory the immigrants in 13 of
                        the British American colonies rebelled against rule and taxes from London, and the United States
                        of America (USA) formally became an independent country in 1776. The individual American
                        colonies morphed into individual states in the USA, with three levels of government.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The political leaders in some of the remaining British colonies decided they wanted more
                        independence and chose negotiation instead of rebellion. The leaders of three mainland colonies
                        met on Prince Edward Island in 1864, and agreed on a strategy that would lead to more
                        independence. After due time and discussions the British North American Act (BNA) was passed by
                        the British Parliament on July 1, 1867. The Dominion of Canada within the British Empire was
                        created and the colonies of Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick became provinces of Canada.
                        The former British colony of Canada was soon split into the Canadian provinces of Ontario and
                        Quebec (formally known as Upper and Lower Canada respectively). In time the two island colonies
                        joined the Dominion of Canada – Prince Edward Island in 1873, the colony of Newfoundland &
                        Labrador became a province of Canada in 1949. Regardless of the size, population, or land area
                        of the new provinces the European fiefdom mentality was transferred across the Atlantic.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rupert’s Land had been the name given to all lands draining from the Prairies east, of the
                        Rockies into Hudson Bay, when the Hudson Bay Company was given a royal charter in 1670 by the
                        British King Charles II. After the BNA became law, the charter was revoked by the British
                        government and the lands became a territory within the new Dominion of Canada. Part of these
                        lands became the province of Manitoba in 1870. The colony of British Columbia became a province
                        in 1871 on condition that a transcontinental railway was built. Finally in 1905 Alberta and
                        Saskatchewan were carved out of the Northwest Territories. Thus the Dominion of Canada spread
                        from coast to coast to coast.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The parts of Canada that were former European colonies seem to have the greatest fiefdom
                        mentality inherited from their colonial roots. The central prairie provinces that were created
                        out of Rupert’s Land have the least. Over the past 150 years, these provinces were mainly
                        populated by indigenous Canadians and new immigrants from other provinces and countries. Many of
                        these immigrants were escaping wars, oppression, or famine in their native countries and brought
                        their cultures and religious practices to Canada.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In recent years there has been a concentrated effort on the economic development of Canada’s
                        vast mineral, energy and water resources in remote regions. At the same time there has been a
                        new awareness of the impact that this development can have on the environment and the regional
                        population. Thus any change in the economy or the environment in any part of Canada must be
                        carefully studied so that the benefits far outweigh the negative impacts. It is safe to say that
                        now in the third millennium, all changes need to come slowly and thoughtfully. The population
                        has to have input at all times but it is important that when decisions are finally made in the
                        national interest, the development of the projects cannot be hijacked by radical groups led by
                        fiefdom politicians, or celebrity names from the entertainment world looking for publicity.

                <h3>Review of similar situations in other countries</h3>
                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <p>
                        In the late 1700s the British seemed to have been the only nation interested in the Australasia
                        region. Their initial plan for Australia was developed in consultation with some of the British
                        loyalists who returned to the British Isles after the establishment of the USA. A fleet of 11
                        ships left Britain in 1787 with some 1500 people aboard. Half were convicts; the remainder were
                        military personnel, loyalist settlers, plus women and children. The objective was to develop
                        penal colonies rather than to derive any immediate direct economic benefit. The British were
                        still smarting from the loss of their North American colonies in 1776 and wanted a different
                        plan for Australia. During this period from 1788 to 1868 over 160,000 convicts (both men and
                        women) were transported to Australia and located in a series of penal colonies in different
                        parts of the Australian island continent. These penal colonies were located in states delineated
                        mainly with straight lines. The largest state by land area was western Australia which comprised
                        almost a third of the continental land area. A review of Australian maps in the 1800s and 1900s
                        shows many changes in the boundaries between the states as the population increased. The term
                        colony in Australia certainly had a different meaning as compared to the Americas!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The British had banished a wide variety of convicts ranging from thieves, murderers, and rebels
                        as well as some with only minor offences who were tradesmen, farmers, etc. Australia was far
                        away, the prisoners were unlikely to escape back to the British Isles, and would eventually
                        become law-abiding tax-paying citizens in a new country.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Originally Australia had been established as a series of penal colonies but its population
                        slowly grew with the arrival of other immigrants. By the mid-1800s it had an estimated
                        population of one million, made up primarily of convicts and their descendants, and the
                        indigenous population. Australia’s distance from the British Isles discouraged voluntary
                        immigration in the early days. The development in the early 1800s of the coal-fired steam engine
                        as a reliable means of propulsion for ships and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1859 meant that
                        Australia gradually became a destination of choice for European immigrants. In the age of steam
                        the voyage from Britain to Australia took six weeks as compared to the voyage to North America
                        that took two - three weeks.

                        Australia became an independent country in January 1, 1901 when the Commonwealth of Australia
                        within the British Empire was created. The country had gone through many internal boundary
                        changes as the five penal colonies on the continent became states and territories. The island of
                        Tasmania is a sixth state.

                    <p>All states and territories have access to tidewater except the Australian Capital Territory
                        (ACT). Australia is different to Canada since it does not share a border with a super power.
                        Australia has a similar land area to Canada and a smaller population mainly concentrated along
                        the east and southeast coast. Like Canada it became a nation on the condition that the western
                        territory was connected by rail with the main population centres in the east. This condition was
                        met in 1917 when a 1920 kilometre long railway was completed which included a 290 kilometre
                        section of straight track without any curves – the longest section of straight railway track in
                        the world.

                        Both Canada and Australia can be classified as developed developing countries due to their low
                        population density. Both countries are blessed with extensive natural resources, which are only
                        valuable when they are produced, then transported to world markets for sale at international
                        prices. In contrast to Canada, all the Australian states and the northern territory have
                        year-round access to tidewater to export their materials and products. The ACT is an
                        administrative territory whose only function is to manage the federal government.

                        Canada is a little older as a country, but can learn something from the Australian experience.
                        Both countries can be defined as developed developing countries and have European roots, a
                        significant indigenous population, and are still desirable countries for immigrants and refugees
                        from all over the world.

                <h3>The role of the civil engineer</h3>
                <div class="two-column font-medium">
                    <p>
                        The civil engineers have an important speciality. They have a wide spectrum of engineering
                        general knowledge, and know when to bring in and manage super specialists on projects. Most
                        experienced civil engineers have a direct speciality which could be valuable on specific
                        projects. Modern civil engineering has its origins in late 1700s Europe during the early days of
                        manufacturing, where industry needed to improve the transportation of raw materials and
                        completed goods through the hilly countryside. Canals had been used in the flat countries of
                        Europe for many years. It was well known that horses could smoothly tow 100 tonnes or more in a
                        barge, compared to maybe only a few tonnes in a cart on a bumpy road. When compared to roads,
                        canals through variable topography demanded significant excavations, larger bridges and lift
                        locks, etc. to operate. This required carefully selecting route locations, improved mapping,
                        mathematical calculations and innovative construction ideas – thus civil engineering was born as
                        a profession.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Formal university training for civil engineers started in the early 1800s. With the development
                        of the steam engines and railways, there was enormous opportunities for their planning and
                        design skills all over the world. Most other branches of engineering emerged later as
                        specialities to complement basic civil engineering capabilities. In contrast, there have also
                        been military engineers whose skills are to help wage wars, destroy enemy fortifications, and
                        repair war damage, etc.

                    <p>
                        There are four historic civil engineers who played important roles in the development of Canada
                        in the late 1800s and early 1900s, as Canada emerged as a new nation. The most important project
                        was the development of the Canadian Pacific Railway to connect the east with the west and allow
                        the settlement of the central prairies.

                        <h4>Sandford Fleming (1827 – 1915)
                        </h4>
                        <p>Sandford Fleming is best known for two activities related to railway development in Canada.
                            He was given the task of finding the best route for the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)
                            railway across Canada. After extensive surveys, he selected a northern route that would
                            connect with the Yellowhead Pass through the Rockies. His recommendation was rejected
                            because it was too far north of the border with the USA, and the Canadian government was
                            worried that there might be encroachment of the USA north of the 49th parallel. This route
                            was later used for the Great Northern Railway (the current Canadian National (CN) railway
                            track. Fleming is probably best known for the invention of Standard Time worldwide. This
                            replaced thousands of local times. Fleming realized that long distance railways had
                            schedules, and messages sent by telegraph needed date and time for record purposes. His
                            concept of worldwide Standard Time solved these problems and is still in use today.

                        <p>
                            As construction of the CPR advanced west across the Canadian Prairies, nobody knew the route
                            that the railway would take through the Rockies. Major Rogers was given the task of finding
                            the route and took off on horseback with a small party of surveyors and assistants. After
                            driving his team to near exhaustion, Rogers found the route through the Selkirk Mountains
                            and reported back to the design team at the railhead. His name is memorialized in the name
                            of the route he discovered – Roger’s Pass.

                        </h4>
                        <p>William Van Horne was the chief engineer on the construction of the CPR advancing from the
                            east with his office of mobile engineers, surveyors and designers in railcars that moved as
                            the railhead advanced across the prairies. The project was on a tight schedule that had many
                            political implications. The rail line advanced from the west and met the one from the
                            prairies in Craigellachie on November 7, 1885 where the last spike was ceremoniously
                            hammered into place, to connect the east and west of Canada. He is honoured by a street
                            named after him in the Mile End district of Montreal.

                        </h4>
                        <p>C. D. Howe was an engineer, businessman and politician. He was instrumental in constructing
                            numerous grain storage elevators in Port Arthur, Ontario at the west end of Lake Superior.
                            Grain from prairie trains could be stored more efficiently prior to transport by ship to
                            other locations on the Great Lakes. He was also instrumental in the development of the
                            trans-Canada natural gas pipeline that would carry Alberta gas to Ontario in the 1950s.

                        In addition to these well-known historical names, a multitude of other engineers have
                        contributed their expertise and experience to engineering Canada over the past 150 years. The
                        development of large hydroelectric projects in British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and
                        Labrador, has demonstrated their skills as well as the development of the St. Lawrence Seaway. A
                        more recent example is the design and construction of the 22 kilometre long Confederation Bridge
                        connecting Prince Edward Island to the mainland of Canada, which was completed in 1997.

                        Since the world price of oil rose dramatically in 1973 as a result of the Yom Kippur War in the
                        Middle East, the energy industry has been a big employer of engineers with a couple of
                        short-term slumps. A recent longer correction in the international price of oil and metals has
                        caused a slump in the demand for engineers. It is important to provide productive work for these
                        engineers or their expertise will be lost to Canada. Engineers have a long history of being
                        mobile and could relocate to anywhere in the world where their skills are in demand. The
                        re-engineering of Canada could provide a significant number of interesting engineering jobs over
                        the coming decades.
