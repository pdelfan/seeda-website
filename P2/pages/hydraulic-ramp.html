                    <div class="font-medium article-body">
                        <p>With coal being phased out by governments due to pollution and diesel being used less in
                            comparison to natural gas or oil, it is time to investigate the alternatives for water
                            pumps. Diesel fuel powered pumps are popular and reliable for several simple water pumping
                            projects; however, diesel fuel is known to be high in carbon content, hence, emitting high
                            amounts of carbon pollution.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For comparison, the company named Sustainable Environmental
                            Engineering Development Association (SEEDA) are diving into the technology of hydraulic ram
                            pump systems. Hydraulic ram pump systems are capable of pumping fluids (usually water) up
                            high elevations without the input of any power or electrical source. Therefore, since these
                            pumps rely strictly on hydraulics, fluid mechanics, and pressure differentials, these pumps
                            simply require a difference in elevation drops between two locations. In the fall semester
                            of 2018, SEEDA submitted a student capstone project proposal to the University of Calgary
                            for engineering students to have a chance at designing one of these hydraulic ram pump
                            systems with the objective of determining the viability of this system with a previously
                            built diesel fuel powered pump.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Lobortis elementum</h3>

                        <p>The original scope of the project was to design a hydraulic ram pump system in an area along
                            the Athabasca River. The purpose of the hydraulic ram pump was to replace the diesel fuel
                            powered pumps that are used by nearby farmers and households for pumping their water.
                            Unfortunately, one of the drawbacks as mentioned with hydraulic ram pumps is that they
                            require differences in elevation to produce a “fluid head”. The fluid head is the pressure
                            which is measured by the height to which the fluid that is being pumped can be raised by the
                            pressure.
                        </p>


                        <p>
                            A complication quickly arose when the students involved in the project realized during the
                            site location step that the majority of the locations along the Athabasca River are in areas
                            with minimal height differences. Therefore, in calculating flow parameters and pump rates,
                            the hydraulic ram pump would have failed unless extra construction was completed to add
                            elevation drops. The project was unfortunately at a halt due to the complication.
                        </p>

                        <p class="caption">Lorem ipsum dolor, sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Nam voluptatum,
                            commodi neque vero mollitia expedita sapiente nesciunt, aliquam amet officiis laudantium
                            tempora. Alias architecto quisquam a excepturi aspernatur hic natus!</caption>

                        <p>After consultation between the students and the mentors of SEEDA, a new plan and project
                            scope were sought out. The students were requested to design a Hydraulic Ram Pump Site
                            Locator Manual. This manual was intended to allow any user to determine the flow parameters,
                            ram pump sizing and scaling, and location viability for a hydraulic ram pump system. Whilst
                            keeping the design aspect of the hydraulic ram pump system, the students now had a project
                            that could be made into a product that would prove useful to groups, not only the residents
                            along the Athabasca River, but in communities where obtaining water is difficult.
                        </p>

                        <p>When asked, this is what one of the students, Shane Andrews, had to say about working on the
                            project: “I enjoyed my time working on the project. As with all projects, there are many
                            obstacles and ultimately, setbacks that result in having to move backwards to make
                            corrections. SEEDA was helpful in mentoring us and teaching us about the hydraulic ram pump
                            systems and I believe that the new manual has more use to them rather than the original
                            project they proposed to us. I think the concept of the manual will be beneficial to its
                            users and I am curious to see how users will use it, whether it be for agriculture or for
                            access to drinking water.”

                        <h3>Arcu felis bibendum</h3>

                        <p>Working closely with SEEDA was interesting for me as I had never heard of the company before
                            the hydraulic ram pump project. Seeing all the other interesting sustainable projects and
                            services that SEEDA has to offer builds a foundation of hope in defining sustainable
                            development, as well as paving a path for a new greener future.
